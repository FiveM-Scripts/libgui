#libgui

*NOTE: Very very early in progress right now, documentation will come alongside code progress!*

A GUI library for FiveM, featuring (or rather is going to feature):

- Actual windows, freely moveable and (in the future very likely) resizable

- Many unique window elements, ranging from simple texts to lists and sliders

- A very easy API, making creating GUIs a breeze!

- Customizability

- And probably more...
